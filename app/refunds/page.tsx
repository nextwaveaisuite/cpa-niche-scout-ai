      <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

      <p>
        CPA Niche Scout AI provides digital software services with immediate
        access upon purchase. This policy governs refund eligibility.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Refund Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        Refund requests may be reviewed within seven (7) days of purchase if the
        service is demonstrably non-functional or materially different from its
        described operation.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Non-Refundable Use</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the digital nature of the service, refunds are generally not
        available once credits, Pro access, or features have been accessed or
        consumed.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Abuse Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds may be denied where excessive usage, abuse, or attempts to
        circumvent system limitations are detected.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Refund Requests</h2>
      <p>
        All refund inquiries must be submitted to:
        <br />
        <strong>support@nextwaveaisuite.com</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        All refund determinations are final and made at our sole discretion.
